# web-scrapping
Some code that I wrote for fun. It <br/> 
  * scrapes the NBER RA positions website (https://www.nber.org/career-resources/research-assistant-positions-not-nber), 
  * creates a .txt file saved to your computer
  * sends an email to your mailbox containing the 3 latest positing in case there is new positing
  * repeats itself 1 hour later otherwise
<br/> <br/>
Note: I implemented the email funtionality with environment variables so you have to supply your own email address and password in case you want to test it out.
